# Testing the owner rep

This is the design for how the rep is tested: two layers of tests, each proving something
the other cannot, and a doctor that plants known defects to prove the tests bite. It is a
plan with a status line per part. Build it in the order given at the end, and keep the status
lines true as parts land.

## Why two layers

The rep's code fails in three ways:

- Pure functions in `hooks/rep.ts` (prompts, parsers, the status words, cost arithmetic)
  fail when an input shape was not thought of. The command that begins by setting a
  variable, which drew shell syntax in the strip on 14 Oct 2026, was one of these.
- Hook bodies in `hooks/register.tsx` (what happens on a prompt, a tool call, a turn step,
  a turn end, a button press) fail when the sequence is wrong: a flag shown twice, a stale
  check overwriting a newer card, a note shown while another mod draws.
- The engine wiring fails when a Claude Code release renames a field or stops raising an
  event. The mods API is early access and changes between releases, and this failure is
  silent: the hook is skipped and the strip quietly stops updating.

The first two are proved by the test kit; the third only by a real session.

## Layer 1: the test kit

`claude plugin test .` runs `tests/rep.test.tsx` against the engine itself. The test holds
the engine's `$` and an `on` whose hooks sit beneath the mod, standing for the engine. A call
such as `$.tool.call`, `$.prompt.submit` or `$.turn.complete` runs through the mod's hooks
as a session does, and `$.ui.mount` draws the strip through the mod's render hook, so a test
makes the call and then reads the strip, the store or a toast to see what the hook did.

This was settled by a run on 14 Oct 2026 (a probe mod with three hook styles, each reporting
through a toast, all three reached). An earlier attempt had mounted the strip before an
unawaited call had started, which looked like the kit not reaching the hook. Await every
engine call before asserting.

Tests to add, one per sequence rule the hooks enforce:

- A flag already shown is not shown again as a note.
- Typing past a note backs the watch off.
- A newer check press makes an older run's answer stale; the stale answer does not rewrite
  the card.
- A `turn.complete` while a check runs does not clear the card.
- The status words for each tool kind, and the mark for the states that need a look
  (stopped, asking, a plan waiting).
- The note waits while another mod draws something beneath the row.
- The digit hotkeys leave the row while another mod draws, and return after.
- The record keeps only the newest `SESSIONS_MAX` sessions.

**Status.** 15 tests cover the parsers, the status words (including the variable-first
command, read through the mounted strip), the goal pin, the checker's prompt and tools, the
row on both surfaces, the briefing card, the going-well card, another mod's tree beneath, and
the model-failure toast. None of the sequence rules above has a test yet.

## Layer 2: a real session

**Problem.** Layer 1 proves the code does what it says when the engine calls it. It cannot
prove that the build the owner runs calls it, with the fields the code expects.

**Design.** A script under `tests/live/` that starts a fresh `claude` session in tmux in a
scratch folder, accepts the trust prompt, sends a prompt, captures the screen on a loop and
asserts on the captured text. The nested-session environment variables (`CLAUDECODE`,
`CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID`, `CLAUDE_CODE_CHILD_SESSION`, the messaging socket and token) must be
unset or `claude` falls into print mode and exits. Scenarios, one capture each:

1. Idle: the row draws with the placeholder goal and "idle".
2. A shell command that begins by setting a variable: the status is "running <program>" and
   no character of the command appears in the strip.
3. `Owner rep goal: ...` typed as a prompt: the goal is pinned and the agent never answers it.
4. The Rep button pressed mid-turn: the briefing card appears with its buttons.
5. The session stopped: the status is "stopped, waiting on you" with the mark.

It runs on demand, not under `claude plugin test`, because each scenario costs a model call
and about a minute. Its output is the captured screens, kept beside the script, so a reader
can see what the strip showed.

**Status.** The capture method is proven (scenario 2 was run by hand on 14 Oct 2026 and
showed "running agentsview"); no script is checked in yet.

## The doctor

**Problem.** A test suite that passes proves nothing unless it is known to fail when the code
is wrong. An agent that edits a test until it passes, or a refactor that silently stops a test
from exercising its target, leaves a green suite that guards nothing.

**Design.** Mutation testing, written by hand so each defect is legible. A file lists named
defects. Each one is a small patch to the mod plus one plain sentence saying what it breaks,
for example:

- `strip-shows-command`: the shell status returns the command's first two words again.
- `flag-shown-twice`: the watch forgets which flags it has shown.
- `stale-check-wins`: an older check run overwrites a newer card.
- `goal-reaches-agent`: an `Owner rep goal:` prompt is passed through to the agent.
- `digits-doubled`: the row keeps its digit hotkeys while another mod draws.

The doctor makes a throwaway worktree of the mod, applies one defect, runs
`claude plugin test`, and expects at least one failure. A defect that survives is a gap in
the suite, and the doctor names it and the sentence. It never touches the main checkout,
because the owner's live sessions load the mod from there and a planted defect would reach
them. It can also run the layer 2 script against a defect to prove the live check bites.

Every fixed bug adds a defect to the list, starting with `strip-shows-command`. Run the
doctor before any claim that the tests pass.

**Status.** Built: `tests/doctor/doctor.py`, with `defects.json` and one patch per defect in
`tests/doctor/defects/`. Run it with `python3 tests/doctor/doctor.py`; it exits 1 when the
clean suite fails or a defect survives. One entry so far, `strip-shows-command`, caught by
three tests on 14 Oct 2026. A throwaway entry no test looks at was planted the same day to
show the survivor path reports and exits 1; it was not kept.

## Order of work

1. ~~The doctor, with `strip-shows-command` as its one entry.~~ Done 14 Oct 2026.
2. The layer 1 sequence-rule tests, with a doctor entry for each.
3. The layer 2 script with the five scenarios.
4. Keep growing the defect list as bugs are fixed.
